elb.existing.dns_name | nil | For managed route53 record when using `config.dns.domain` option. Since UFO does not manage the ELB, this allows UFO to map the route53 dns record when needed. UFO infers the ELB dns name from the target group. However, in the case when the target group is associated with multiple ELBs, UFO cannot infer it and this setting is required. See: [Existing Load Balancer Docs]({% link _docs/features/load-balancer/existing.md %}).
elb.existing.target_group | nil | Existing ELB target group. When using `elb.existing.target_group` the other elb settings are ignored since they only apply the ELB ufo manages. In the case of using an existing target group, the ELB is managed outside of UFO. You're bring your own ELB.
