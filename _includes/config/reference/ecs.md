ecs.cluster | :ENV | Notice that the default is a pattern. By default, the `:ENV` pattern is expanded as the value of env var `UFO_ENV=dev`. So, by convention, the ECS cluster that ufo deploys to matches the `UFO_ENV`. If `UFO=prod`, then `ufo ship` deploys to the `prod` ECS cluster. This is option overrides this convention.
ecs.deployment_configuration | nil | Full control over the [DeploymentConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ecs-service-deploymentconfiguration.html).This option is passed straight through to the CloudFormation template, so you should use CamelCase for the keys. Also when used, overrides `ecs.maximum_percent` and `ecs.minimum_healthy_percent`.
ecs.desired_count. | nil | Only respected when `autoscaling.enabled = false`.
ecs.maximum_percent | 200 | Upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment. This is part of [DeploymentConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ecs-service-deploymentconfiguration.html).
ecs.minimum_healthy_percent | 100 | Lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment. This is part of [DeploymentConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ecs-service-deploymentconfiguration.html).
ecs.scheduling_strategy | REPLICA | ECS Scheduling Strategy. IE: REPLICA or DAEMON
