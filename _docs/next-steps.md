This concludes the tutorial guide for ufo. Hopefully, you are now more comfortable with ufo's basic usage, concepts, and have a feel for the workflow.

From here, there are a few resources that can help you continue along:

* Check out the [ufo](https://github.com/tongueroo/ufo) repo on GitHub
* Submit an issue
* Write a blog post describing how you are using ufo, or an interesting problem ufo has allowed you to solve

Everyone can contribute to make ufo better, including the documentation. These docs are of the same ufo repo in the [docs repo](https://github.com/boltops-tools/ufo-docs/tree/master). Please fork the project and open a pull request!  We love your pull requests. Contributions are encouraged and welcomed!
