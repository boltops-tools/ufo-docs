title: Cluster Setup

You'll need an ECS cluster. Setting up an ECS cluster is a bit out of scope for this tutorial. We'll provide the docs and links, though.

## Create an ECS cluster

Here are the AWS docs to create an ECS cluster:

* [Creating a cluster for the Fargate launch type using the new console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-cluster-console-v2.html)
* [Creating a cluster for the Amazon EC2 launch type using the new console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-ec2-cluster-console-v2.html)

For this guide and simplicity, we'll use an ECS EC2 cluster deployed into the default VPC

Next, we'll set up a project with ufo.
